Research Question: Would it be possible to use machine learning techniques to help NFL defenses combat offenses by predicting the most likely play they will run (pass vs. run)?

During each NFL game, we only see about 11 minutes of action during the 60 minute runtime. Even then, the action and results are only a fraction of the research and work that gets put in by coordinators and coaches to prepare for matchups. As a defensive coordinator, part of that research is being able to guess what the opposing offense will do for each play and provide the proper scheme and design against that play. This process depends heavily on their ability to correctly predict what the offense has planned.
